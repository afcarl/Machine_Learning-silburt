# Machine_Learning
This repository contains various machine learning/data science projects that Iâ€™ve done. A brief summary of each:  

- Stock_Correlation: Performs stock correlations and unsupervised stock clustering for different financial sectors.  
- Fundamental Analysis: Applies machine learning to stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index to predict whether a given stock price will increase or decrease over the coming year. Uses fundamental analysis as features.
- Lyric Analysis: Analyzes the broad lyrical trends of five different genres - rap, rock, country, rap, EDM - and also uses an LSTM to try and generate new lyrics from each genre (LSTM in prep).
